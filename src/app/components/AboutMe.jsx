                        ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I&apos;m Sohan! I am a third-year Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University.
                        I specialize in Full Stack Development and AI but I am also interested in Data Analysis & UX Design. 
                        I am a huge fan of MMA and other combat sports! My favourite thing about coding is being able to build something from seemingly nothing.
                        Isn&apos;t it weird how a bunch of words and numbers combined together can make a functioning website like this? 
                        I also love being able to create compelling stories out of raw data, as once more it&apos;s fascinating how a sheet full of numbers can really tell you a lot about a subject.
                        If you find any of my projects interesting and would like to talk more, feel free to email me, add me on discord or connect with me on my LinkedIn!
                    </p>
