            üëã Hey there, I&apos;m Sohan! I am a third-year Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University, currently completing my first-ever co-op at RBC, 
            where I&apos;m working on Mainframe systems. I specialize in Full Stack Development and UX Design, but lately, I&apos;ve been exploring more AI concepts, such as fine-tuning models that predict based on long time series data (not a big fan of the gen AI hype) as well as learning more about DevOps. <br /><br />
            I&apos;m very passionate about coding, especially the engineering and architecture part of it. I love the process of identifying problems, designing system architectures and solutions, determining their feasibility, 
            and breaking it all down into manageable components. The development and implementation part is the rewarding "cherry on top" üçí after all the problem-solving. <br /><br />
            Aside from work and tech, I&apos;m also the Vice President of Laurier Grappling ü•ã, an athletic club, where we offer co-ed and women&apos;s-only grappling sessions at affordable prices for students. I&apos;m a huge fan of MMA and combat sports, always looking to push myself physically and mentally. 
            I also love music üé∂ and enjoy tracking my listening stats. I‚Äôd love to work on a project analyzing music data! <br /><br />
            I love being exposed to new experiences and learning from them üìö. I&apos;m always eager to connect with professionals, students, or anyone‚Äîwhether they&apos;re in my field or not‚ÄîI would love to hear your story. 
            Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn üîó, or reach out via email üìß or Discord üí¨. Let&apos;s chat about jobs, tech, or anything interesting!
